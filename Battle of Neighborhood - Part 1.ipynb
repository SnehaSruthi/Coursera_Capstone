The earliest Japanese immigrants to settle in NYC came in 1876, mostly merchants who set up businesses to import silk. By 1900, there were approximately 1,000 first generation immigrants in New York State, almost all of them in New York City.\n\nAs of 2019, 30,000 Japanese nationals and a total of 45,000 reside in the Greater New York City area. Many of the Japanese are from transient groups such as university students, artists, and business workers.\nOver 30,000 Japanese nationals live throughout the five boroughs of New York City. However, New York's \"Japantown\" usually referred to as Little Tokyo, is located on the Lower East Side, between 2nd and 3rd Avenues and 8th (St Mark's Place) and 10th Streets, nothing comparable to New York's famous Chinatown.\n\nThis report explores which neighborhood and boroughs of New York City have the most as well as the best Japanese restaurants. Additionally, there will be an attempt to answer the questions “Where should I open an Japanese Restaurant?” and “Where should I stay If I want great Japanese food?” to meet the needs of the working professionals and students.
